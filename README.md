# Notes App Using PHP

Hii  I am Benison Abraham, this was attempt at learning PHP, from [Laracast.Com](laracast.com). The Lessons were amazing providing great insights into PHP and features provided by this Language. Coming from a node.js background the lesson were easy to grasp. I will continue learning PHP-Laravel after this.

## What I learnt

I came to understanding PHP is really good programming language for server-side render. It comes built-in with tools for Developers with create a Server-Side Web App.  

Throughout my journey as new aspiring php developer i came to understanding of how many frameworks work and why their is a necesasity for them.

## Future Updations

### Backend Developments

I believe register routes need to be refactored, more readable.

### UI Developments

This App was not created with UI Elements in mind. I hope to improve its UI in future.

### Testing

In Future i would also like to learn Unit Testing as well.
