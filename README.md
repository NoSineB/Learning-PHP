# Notes App Using PHP

Hii  I am Benison Abraham, this was attempt at learning PHP, from [Laracast.Com](laracast.com). The Lessons were amazing providing great insights into PHP and features provided by this Language. Coming from a node.js background the lesson were easy to grasp. I will continue learning PHP-Laravel after this.

## What I learnt

I came to understanding PHP is really good programming language for server-side render. It comes built-in with tools for Developers with create a Server-Side Web App.  

Throughout my journey as new aspiring php developer i came to understanding of how many frameworks work and why their is a necesasity for them.

## How to run the app

- git clone into your PC

`git clone https://github.com/NoSineB/Notes-App-Using-PHP.git`

- Change directory

`cd Notes-App-Using-PHP`

- Open Terminal and run

`composer install`
- After Installation Run

`php -S localhost:8888 -t public`

*`
Please note this might not work if you try run without seting up the proper config. Check out **config.php** to get proper clarity

## Future Updations

### Backend Developments

I believe register routes need to be refactored, more readable.

### UI Developments

This App was not created with UI Elements in mind. I hope to improve its UI in future.

### Testing

In Future i would also like to learn Unit Testing as well.


## Updation

So if you are following up until now, that means you might have seen that i have not done any updation until now. This is because instead of doing all the updations here, instead i have created a new repository **[2do App]()**.

I thought out makeing updation in this same app, but after learning Laravel I thought that i should remake the same todo app using it. Hence if your are interested check it out.
